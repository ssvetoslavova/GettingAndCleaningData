run_analysis.R that does the following. 

1 Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2 Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3 Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4 Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5 From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Please upload the tidy data set created in step 5 of the instructions. Please upload your data set as a txt file created with write.table() using row.name=FALSE (do not cut and paste a dataset directly into the text box, as this may cause errors saving your submission).
